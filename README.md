# Lexicon Induction with Socio-Temporal Nuance (De Kock, ACL 2025)

This repo contains two files: 
# gold_standard.csv 
Our manually validated test set, containing verified positive (1) and negative (0) samples, capturing whether the word represents valid in-group language within the manosphere according to a domain expert.

# lexicon_with_scores.csv: 
A lexicon of 938 manosphere-related words, with scores corresponding to their relevance to one of the 7 communities included in our study. This data was used to create Figure 2 and Table 3 in the paper. NOTE: we provide scores for our own lexicon as well as lexica from prior work, as described in Table 1. This is reflected in the "origin" column. We include only lexical innovations, whereas other works have opted to include standard terms as well.

Full details are provided in the paper.
